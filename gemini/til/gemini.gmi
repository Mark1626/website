# Gemini Markdown

=> index.gmi Back

Gemini markdown seems rather simple compared to regular markdown.

* Lines are not wrapped at 80 characters, so they can get very long
* Heading are same as markdown #, ##, ###
* List is also the same as markdown using *
* Preformatted text uses ```

And that it!!
